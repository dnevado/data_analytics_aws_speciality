The core of this question is how to send event messages to Kinesis synchronously vs. asynchronously.
The critical events must be sent synchronously, and the informational events can be sent asynchronously. The
Kinesis Producer Library (KPL) implements an asynchronous send function, so it can be used for the
informational messages. PutRecords is a synchronous send function, so it must be used for the critical events.

	The most scalable solutions are the UNLOAD/COPY solutions because they will work in parallel, which
eliminates A and D as answers. Option C is incorrect because the data would not be encrypted in flight, and you
cannot encrypt an entire bucket with a KMS key. Option B meets the encryption requirements, the UNLOAD
ENCRYPTED command automatically stores the data encrypted using-client side encryption and uses HTTPS to
encrypt the data during the transfer to S3.

	Amazon Redshift can use an on-premises HSM for key management over the VPN, which ensures that
	the encryption keys are locally managed. Option B is possible: CloudHSM can cluster to an on-premises HSM.
	But then key management could be performed on either the on-premises HSM or CloudHSM, and that doesnâ€™t
	meet the design goal. Option C does not describe a valid feature of KMS and violates the requirement for the
	corporate HSM to manage the keys requirement, even if it were possible. Option D is not possible because you
	cannot put hardware into an AWS Region
